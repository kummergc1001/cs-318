        <p>Salem is my roommates cat and I've been living with him for two years. I went to the humane society with my roommate to adopt Salem, so I am his aunt. I love living with salem because it's a new thing every day. With cats, you have to build a relationship with them. Over time you learn more aout your cat and how weird they are. Here's a couple fun facts about our cat, Salem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salem goes crazy for tuna</li>
            <li>He loves mornings</li>
            <li>He has a little white patch on his tummy</li>
            <li>He's friends with my roommate's hamster, Solar</li>
            <li>He likes to sit on our plant shelf and pretend he's in the wilderness</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, I love having a cat. Salem is full of personality and a friend in the house. He loves being the center of attention and is an amazing source of comfort. Salem is an emotional support cat and really helps. When salem is gone, the house feels empty. Here are some reason's why salem is a great emotional support cat:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>He will always greet you in the morning</li>
            <li>Caring for another animal is a reminder to care for yourself</li>
            <li>He makes me smile on a daily basis</li>
            <li>One on one, he loves to cuddle</li>
            <li>He'll take naps with you</li>
        </ol>
